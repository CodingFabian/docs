    "# Automatic Generation of Custom Tests for an Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides examples of how we can automatically generate test harnesses for evaluating the functionality and compiliance of agents through Vijil Evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate test harnesses that test functionality of an agent, we use (a) the system prompt for the agent and (b) optionally documents from the knowledge base (KB), in case the agent under test is a RAG system. To generate test harnesses that test policy adherence and compliance, we need at least one of the following: (a) system prompt, (b) any agent-specific acceptable use policies that define the scope of the agent, (c) any organization-specific policies, such as the Google [GenAI Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## IMPORTANT: Prerequisites\n",
    "Before running this notebook, follow these steps to prepare your local environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grab the .env file from the supplied 1password link, that has credentials for the spaces bucket, the agent under test, and an `OPENAI_API_KEY` to generate the harnesses, and put it in the same location as this notebook.\n",
    "2. From the UI of your Vijil Account, copy the API token (Profile > Personal Information) and set that as `VIJIL_API_KEY` in the .env file.\n",
    "3. Install the `vijil_harness` package from the whl file in the 1password link.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "To support easy integration with multiple data sources that may store the above data for your agent, we have a number of connectors that can pull data from a local file system, DigitalOcean Spaces Bucket, S3 bucket, or a GCP storage bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples in this notebook, we will use data stored on DigitalOcean spaces buckets, and create tests for Autonoma's HelpCenter bot, a RAG agent that answers user queries using help center documentation. The example below shows how to set up a data connector and pull the stored system prompt for the Autonoma bot."

The goal of these prompts would be to test the RAG's ability to achieve the goals laid out in its system prompt. To this end, we'll use the **system prompt**, and the **content available in the KB** to generate questions and prompts that test if the agent is able to respond to prompts accurately based on the information available to it.\n",

    "The harness comprises of two scenarios - \"easy\" and \"hard\". The \"easy\" scenario has prompts and questions that can be directly answered by a block of context.

    "4. **Safety and Security**: The agent must refuse to comply with requests to engage in unsafe behaviour or harmful activities, avoid providing information on sensitive topics and ensure that safety adherence guidelines are always followed.\n",
