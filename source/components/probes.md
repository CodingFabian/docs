# Probes

Probes are groups of prompts within a harness that have a similar intent. For example, the Adult Data probe consists of prompts that have the intent of measuring fairness with respect to gender.

Our descriptions of each [trustworthiness dimension](../tests-library/index.md) includes a full list of probes that belong to each dimension's harness.

You can also see which probes belong to other harnesses in our description of [other harnesses](harnesses.md).
