# Integrity

Integrity methods evaluate query strings based on some available context to check for possible hallucinations and ungrounded or incorrect conclusions. Integrity methods will typically only apply to output guards in RAG-based applications.

All integrity models support **context** as a parameter where the context for the detector can be initialized. 

````{warning}
Integrity methods are currently experimental! We are in the process of experimentally validating them and integrating them into Dome's workflow in a RAG setting.

## HHEM (`hhem-hallucination`)
Uses the [HHEM Model by Vectara](https://huggingface.co/vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model) to determine if there might be possible model hallucinations.

**Parameters**

- **context** (optional str): Sets the initial context.
- **factual_consistency_score_threshold**   (optional float): The factual consistency score threshold.
**Important**: any input where the factual consistency score is _lower_ than the threshold is classified as a possible hallucination. Default value is 0.5.

## Hallucination Prompt Engineering (`hallucination-llm`)
Uses a prompt template outlined in [NeMo Guardrails](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/user_guides/guardrails-library.html#hallucination-detection) to detect hallucinations given a context and hypothesis.

**Parameters**

- **context**  (optional str): Sets the initial context.
- **hub_name** (optional str): The hub that hosts the model you want to use. Currently supports OpenAI (`openai`), Together (`together`) and OctoAI (`octo`). Default value is `openai`.
- **model_name** (optional str): The model that you want to use. Default: `gpt-4o`. Please ensure that the model you wish to use is compatible with the hub you selected. 
- **api_key**  (optional str): Specify the API key you want to use. By default this is not specified and the API key is pulled directly from the environment variables. The environment variables used are `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OCTO_API_KEY`, and `TOGETHER_API_KEY` for the corresponding hubs. 

## Fact-Check Classifier (`fact-check-roberta`)
Uses a [fine-tuned RoBERTa model](https://huggingface.co/Dzeniks/roberta-fact-check) to detect possible factual inconsistencies by examining the joint encoding of a context string and a query string and classifying if the context supports or refutes the claim. 

**Parameters**


- **context**  (optional str): Sets the initial context.

## Fact-Check Prompt Engineering (`fact-check-llm`)
Uses a prompt template outlined in [NeMo Guardrails](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/user_guides/guardrails-library.html#fact-checking) to detect if a claim is grounded in some context. 

**Parameters**

- **context**  (optional str): Sets the initial context.
- **hub_name** (optional str): The hub that hosts the model you want to use. Currently supports OpenAI (`openai`), Together (`together`) and Octo (`octo`). Default value is`openai`.
- **model_name**   (optional str): The model that you want to use. Default is `gpt-4o`. Please ensure that the model you wish to use is compatible with the hub you selected. 
- **api_key**  (optional str): Specify the API key you want to use. By default this is not specified and the API key is pulled directly from the environment variables. The environment variables used are `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OCTO_API_KEY`, and `TOGETHER_API_KEY` for the corresponding hubs.
