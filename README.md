## About Vijil

Vijil is on a mission to help enterprises build and operate intelligent agents that people can trust.

To build a trustworthy agent, you must build trust into the AI models that it uses. For that, you must be able to inspect, modify, and control the models. This is easier to do when the models are open-source.

Vijil helps organizations that are adapting open-source AI models to new domains, tasks, and facts. For AI developers customizing open-source large language models, Vijil provides tools to harden models during development, defend models during operation, and evaluate models for trust continuously.
